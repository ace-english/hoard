If you're using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, there should be an option to Import From Github, at which point you just enter the URL of the root on Github.

Otherwise, I recommend grabbing Git Bash here: https://git-scm.com/downloads but GUI based clients also exist
You will have to log in using your github credentials on whatever shell client you are using.
Send me your github account's associated email. so I can add you as a contributor.

To download the github repository just click the link on the github page labeled "Clone or Download", or use the command "git clone https://github.com/ace-english/hoard.git" from the git client in the folder you want it to be.

After you set up, do a "git commit pull" to grab the most local copy from github.

When you add a new file (like a texture or a class or whatever" you have to use "git add <filename>"

Every time you make a significant change (like 15-30 minutes of work or so) make sure to do 'git commit -am "description of changes"'

When you have a working copy with changes going (maybe at the end of your code session or every 1-2 hours):
	1. do a git pull to grab any recent changes
	2. do a commit
	3. push the changes to github with "git push". If this doesn't work then there's probably a conflict like if we're both working at the same time and then things get complicated and we have to fix whatever files get mentioned.
	
If the code gets messed up while working on it you can revert to the most recently pushed change with "git checkout --<filename>"
